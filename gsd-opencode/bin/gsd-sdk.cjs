/**
 * bin/gsd-sdk.js — shim for external callers of `gsd-sdk`.
 *
 * When the parent package is installed globally (`npm install -g gsd-opencode`
 * or `npx gsd-opencode`), npm creates a `gsd-sdk` symlink in the global bin
 * directory pointing at this file. npm correctly chmods bin entries from a tarball,
 * so the execute-bit problem that afflicted the sub-install approach (issue #2453)
 * cannot occur here.
 *
 * This shim resolves sdk/dist/cli.js relative to its own location and delegates
 * to it via `node`, so `gsd-sdk <args>` behaves identically to
 * `node <packageDir>/sdk/dist/cli.js <args>`.
 *
 * Call sites (slash commands, agent prompts, hook scripts) continue to work without
 * changes because `gsd-sdk` still resolves on PATH — it just comes from this shim
 * in the parent package rather than from a separately installed @gsd-build/sdk.
