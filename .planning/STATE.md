## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Agent frontmatter rewriting is the only mechanism for per-stage model control in OpenCode
- [Roadmap]: OpenCode Zen free models used as defaults (zero cost, good quality)
- [Roadmap]: Config stored in .planning/config.json (matches existing GSD patterns)

- [01-01]: Config helper documented as an @-referenceable markdown "library" with pseudocode procedures
- [01-01]: Profiles schema lives under `profiles` and merges with existing config keys (mode/depth/parallelization preserved)

- [01-02]: active_profile defaults to 'balanced' per documented behavior
- [01-02]: Validation error messages and corruption recovery deferred to Phase 3

- [02-01]: Presets stored at `profiles.presets` in config.json and are user-editable
- [02-01]: Stage-to-agent mapping documented for future frontmatter rewriting (Phase 5)

- [02-02]: Baseline config keys vary across repos/templates; `writeConfig()` must deep-merge overlays and preserve unknown keys (profile work is additive under `profiles.*`).
